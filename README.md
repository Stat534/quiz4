### Question 1

##### a. (5 points)
Simulate a spatial process, using a 50-by-50 grid, with an exponential covariance function $\sigma^2 = 1$, $\tau^2 =1$, $\phi = 2$. Include your plot here.

##### b. (5 points)
Comment on how changing the parameters: $\sigma^2, \tau^2 =1, and \phi = 2$ changes the simulated spatial process. You don't need to include additional figures, but rather summarize the impact of each parameter (or possible combinations of parameters).
